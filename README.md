# hello-world
I think the book depository would be a good bet! (aka my first repository)

So, this is me following the GitHub Hello World guide.

At this moment, I'm a 30 year old white English male... 
That's an odd comment, because it's not like I'm going to become a 56 year old Venezulean female any time soon. 
I'm going to carry on being a white English male - the only thing that will change is my age and even that isn't for a while yet.
